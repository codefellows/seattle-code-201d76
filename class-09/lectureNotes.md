# Lecture Notes

## forms in html
- forms take in data from the user and so something with it 
- have a weird default behavior where they erase your data! how rude
- all form data comes in as the 'string' datatype - just like when we had prompt (parseInt or Number)
- we can recieve data from a *submit event*

## Browser Events
- pretty much any time a user interacts with the browser that is an event

- you can activate a listener in javascript too react or do something if a specific event occurs

## js event listeners
- specify a `target` to listen to (my submit button/form)
- add a listener to the js
- say what we are listening for (a submit event to occur)
- what do I do if I hear it?!

5. Add event listeners
