### controlling layout
How to get stuff to go where I want it to!
- **positioning**
- **float**
- flexbox ** later
- grid ** later

### designing a webpage
- create an idea of a layout before you write your html
- identify the parts we need to put into the html (bio, top ten)
- add other things that we like
- write the html to fit the design, not the other way around

To create a new branch:
- `git checkout -b branchName`

Do your work and save your files then a-c-p to that branch name
- `git add allMyFiles.js`
- `git commit -m "adds all my files"`
- `git push origin branchName`

Go to github.com
- accept or create a pull request for the branch
- merge the branch

Update your local repo with the current version of main
- `git pull origin main`

Optional
- delete branch locally
  - `git branch -d localBranchName`
- delete branch remotely
  - `git push origin --delete remoteBranchName`
