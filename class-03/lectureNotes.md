# Lecture Notes

## Truthy and Falsey
- in javascript we use boolean **true** and **false**
- all other true/false values are refered to as **truthy** or **falsey**

## Falsey Values
- false
- 0 (zero)
- '' (empty string)
- null
- undefined
- NaN (not a number)
  - let pizza = 'delicious'
  - parseInt(pizza) === NaN

## comparison operators

a == b - "loosely equal" this checks for value but not type 10 == '10'

a === b - "strictly equal" this would check both value and type 10 === 10

a != b - 'Not equal to' 10 != "string" 

a !== b - 'Not strictly equal to' 

a > b - "greater than"

a < b - "less than"

a >= b - "greater than or equal to"

a <= b - "less than or equal to"

## logical operators

a && b - AND BOTH HAVE TO TRUE

a || b - OR if EITHER are true, this is true

!a - BANG is not true

## Arrays
- datatype of object 
- list of elements - elements can be any data type 
- JS allows you to make a mutable length array 
- every element in a the array has an index value - 'key' for where it can be found in the array 
- js arrays are a zero based index
- let myArray = ['cookies', 'pizza']

## loops

### what are they?
- a very common pattern 
- a block of code that repeats until a condition is no longer true

## why
- save us from writing repetitive code - 'dry'
- help prevent bugs
